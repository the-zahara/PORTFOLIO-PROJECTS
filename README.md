Welcome!

This repository showcases my work as a data analyst, featuring a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling.

ABOUT ME

As a detail-driven data analyst, I help organizations make data-informed decisions by extracting insights from complex data sets. With expertise in [list specific tools and technologies, e.g., Excel, SQL, Tableau, Python, R], I excel at transforming data into actionable recommendations.
